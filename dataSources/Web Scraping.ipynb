No longer easy to see all unread messages in one place - which was a feature I regularly requested for the desktop app. Now, the iPad app has been turned to be quite bland. Seems like the “Dark Mode” folks won the design argument; as the new app no longer supports the desktop or web app color themes; which now makes the iPad app incredibly difficult to know at a glance which team you’re viewing. Also frustrating are the 3 or so “Unread Direct Messages” you can see, when you tap “Show All” it takes you to the “Direct Messages” sidebar that sorts in its own way, with unreads strewn about. Also, Direct message addresses are much harder to read; too much text all clumped together. Unfortunate for the iPad app, Slack has taken a once very useful version (preferred as a second screen in some cases over the desktop app) and made it into a giant iPhone app. The iPhone app now also suffers from this Direct Message unread messages “Show All” problem. The only way to return some of the missing sort and see all DMs on the iPad app is to select the sort option of “by recent” but it does not group unreads. 7 years using Slack, and this is by far the most disappointing iPad app “upgrade.” Repackage the desktop app for the iPad and call it “Slack Pro” for iPad Pro users who use their iPad in place of a laptop.',\n",

I know Slack used to be a game company, but this is not the type of game I’m interested in playing :) \\nI also find the app to respond slow on iPadOS, as if it’s not native but some kind of ‘HTML shell’ that doesn’t really bring the best of the native CPU/GPU capabilities. \\nLastly, I think they need to rework ‘search’. I would like to see a more clear distinction between ‘search everywhere’ and ‘search within the current channel or private conversation’. It takes ages to find something now.

Now with the acquisition from salesforce, I truly feel like Slack is going to go down the drain and what was once the industry leader in communication has sat back on the couch, slacking, watching everybody else move forward. As of today, we are looking into other platforms outside of Slack due to the lack of innovation and buy out from sales force. An example of what I think is easy innovative feedback, we’ve been asking for voice clips to send both privately and in channels up to 2 to 5 minutes long so managers can leave a status update or important message or daily briefing first thing in the morning without having to type it all out and can do it on the go; nothing.

This means my unread messages are scattered all over the place, and as a result I no longer have a way to just see all my unread messages grouped together.

Many of our team are mobile, and while the developers themselves are most always at a desktop, managers and attendees on calls are not - and are unable to view and follow along on the product and issue demos.  Because of this, meetings are now scheduled outside slack on other services like MS teams and GoToMeeting which support viewing from iPad. Once meetings started to move from slack, more communications continue to move out.  Our use case makes sharing from iOS a very very low priority, but viewing other presenters shared screen is a must have.  Without this feature, I find I must only give slack 3 stars.  Otherwise, notifications work well, and messages are solid other than missing multiple levels of bullet indents to make readable lists.',\n",
