992047786,,2017-11-07 16:27:16,"Instead of updating all these little apps can the developer please update AnalogFilm instead? That was one of the best photography apps and even tho some of us have purchased all these newer apps with almost no filters compared to AnalogFilm, we still want the old one back.",1,False,Update AnalogFilm,YazmineReign
992047786,,2017-04-20 23:26:44,"Such a disappointment. The three Analog apps I purchased (Tokyo, Paris, and Budapest) were totally worth the money, so I was expecting this one to be great too. NOPE. The filters hardly do anything - what a dud. Don't think I would download it even if it was free.",1,False,Dull Filters,Bunny Rox

992047786,,2018-08-11 00:02:08,"I have invested in a lot of this developers,apps, and if you add up all the costs of each, it is very expensive compared to other apps that offer similar effects/features.  What is really disappointing I for me is the low resolution output.  I edit 24mp DSLR images on my iPad Pro, and these apps down sample to 7.1mp.  There really is no excuse for that.  I have dozens of photo editing apps that save at full resolution, and even more that save at the 11.2mp,graphics processor hardware limit. If the developer would improve the output, I would gladly feed his need, but I think I’ll cut my loses and dump all of them.

I would really prefer he put out one app, and add the extra filters/effects as IAPs, I don’t need the overhead on my storage consumed by multiple apps.",3,False,disappointing,Techno-nut

1130235239,,2018-09-21 22:28:45,"After reading reviews, I expected much less but everything worked as expected. Most items were easy to find.

1130235239,,2017-04-28 14:34:39,"Graphics were ugly with a washed out appearance.

Game designed so that it doesn't always zoom in when you tap a hot spot. You have to drag things all over. Good example, the 4 arrows. You have to drag them everywhere to find one stupid nonsense spot.

Girl puzzle was AWFUL. Took a lot of effort and maneuvering to get pieces to connect.  A puzzle so easy a little kid could do it but it was but time killer. 

Last clam was difficult to open. It took multiple tries whereas the others opened first try.",1,False,Thrown together just to get a game out there,Tweety8591

1494059209,,2021-12-11 22:47:43,Tried to do an online order. It was awful. I didn’t have an account and had to create an account. Created one with “chow now” in order to avoid downloading their app. However chow now doesn’t update promptly So that was a waste of time because it didn’t recognize my username or password. Then downloaded their app. Similarly terrible experience trying to sign up using my iPhone. The phone number field wouldn’t populate so that was unsuccessful. Just lost my business.,1,False,Signing up,Skhand01
